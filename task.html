        <br>
        <p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:50px;">object in java script like a class in object-oriented languages.object is one of the primitive data type.other primitive data types like string,number,boolean,null,undefined all stores as single values but objects are more complex.
            objects are related data which is unordered collection.it has assigned and un assigned properties.
            example:college name:guvi it has key and values and if values didnt assigned its called as undefined.multiple elements or objects with in square bracket called as a array.
        </p>
        <p>object property has a function method.example to enter house:function(){return door.open).
            object is a constructor function that refers to all the objects created in the document.
